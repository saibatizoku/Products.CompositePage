1.0 (2011-04-30)
----------------

- Fixed test failures caused by 7 years of changes to Zope and Python.
  This mostly involved simple modernization:

    - Use zope.interface, zope.tales, and zope.pagetemplate rather than
      their predecessors.

    - Use absolute imports.

    - Use Unicode where possible.

- Let's stop swallowing errors that occur when rendering the template
  to get the list of slots.  Error messages are friendlier than silent
  breakage.

- Slots now show the add element interface only at the top and bottom
  of the slot, not between elements.  (Hmm, should this be configurable?)


0.2 (2004-06-16)
----------------

- Changed the UI to use images for elements and targets.

- Added inline views.  You can now select templates to render objects.

- Context menus now have headers.

- The clipboard now works.

- You can now define slots in a template using "slot:" expressions.
  This should make it easier to write templates.

- The composite tool now checks copy/paste permissions before making
  any changes.

- Slots now have a __str__ method, making it easy to render them
  directly.
